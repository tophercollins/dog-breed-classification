# End-to-end Multi-class Dog Breed Classification

In this project, we aim to build an end-to-end multi-class image classifier using TensorFlow 2.0 and TensorFlow Hub. The goal of this project is to identify the breed of a dog given an image of that dog. Imagine sitting at a cafe, taking a photo of a dog, and instantly knowing what breed it is!

## Problem

The main problem we're addressing in this project is the classification of dog breeds from images. Given an image of a dog, our model will predict the breed of the dog from a set of possible dog breeds.

## Data

We are using the dog breed identification dataset from Kaggle's dog breed identification competition. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification/data). It contains a large collection of images of various dog breeds, which will serve as our training and testing data.

## Evaluation

The evaluation process involves generating prediction probabilities for each dog breed in the dataset. Our goal is to build a model that achieves high accuracy in correctly classifying the dog breeds.

## Project Details

Here are some key details about the project:

- We're dealing with images, which are unstructured data. Therefore, we will utilize deep learning and transfer learning techniques for better model performance.
- There are a total of 120 different dog breeds, which means we have a multi-class classification problem.
- The training set contains over 10,000 labeled images, each associated with a specific dog breed.
- The test set contains over 10,000 unlabeled images, which we will use to evaluate our model's performance.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up your Python environment with TensorFlow 2.0 and other necessary libraries.
3. Download the dataset from the provided Kaggle link.
4. Explore the dataset and preprocess the images for training.
5. Build and train your multi-class image classifier using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub.
6. Evaluate your model's performance using the provided evaluation process.

## Results

Our ultimate aim is to achieve a highly accurate model that can correctly classify the breed of a dog given its image. After training and evaluation, we will have a clear understanding of how well our model performs on this task.

## Conclusion

The "End-to-end Multi-class Dog Breed Classification" project showcases the process of building a machine learning model to identify dog breeds from images. By utilizing deep learning techniques and transfer learning, we aim to create a model that can accurately predict the breed of a dog, contributing to the field of computer vision and image classification.
